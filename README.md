# Kohort - Contacts Invite Component Challenge

Thanks for taking on this front-end coding challenge by Kohort!

This challenge is designed to help you sharpen your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills by building a real-world UI component — a responsive contacts invite modal with search, filters, and selection interactivity.

> To complete this challenge, you should have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🚀 The Challenge

Your task is to build the Contacts Invite Component and match it as closely as possible to the design provided.

You're free to use any tools, frameworks, or libraries you’d like. Feel free to use this as a way to practice specific skills or explore new ones!

The contact list data is provided in a local `contacts.json` file inside `/assets` folder, so you can render the UI dynamically.

## ✅ User Stories

Your users should be able to:

- 🔍 Search for contacts by name
- 🧩 Filter contacts by group: All, Teams, or Members
- ✅ Select contacts to invite
- 📱 Experience a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes
- 🖱️ See hover and focus states for all interactive elements

## 📁 What’s Included

- 🖼️ [Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/design/eLWw9KmjCzmwLpKW0nKkrP/Contacts-Search-Component?node-id=0-1&t=gEhcHfXQiWv0ZJ3X-1) – with different components and styling references
- 📦 [Contacts Data](./assets/contacts.json) – to render contact items dynamically
- 📦 [Images](./assets/images) – profile pictures used for contacts cards
- 📚 [Style Guide](./DESIGN-GUIDE.md) – with color palette and font information

## 🚧 Suggested Workflow

You can follow any process you prefer, but here’s a simple guide to help you get started:

1. **Set up your project**

   - Create a GitHub repo (or use your preferred version control).
   - Clone it locally and install any necessary tools (if using a bundler or framework).

2. **Deploy your project**

   - Host it online with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), or [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

3. **Plan the UI**

   - Review the Figma design and plan your HTML layout.
   - Identify reusable CSS classes and component logic.

4. **Start with HTML**

   - Write semantic, accessible markup for your search, filters, contact cards, and buttons.

5. **Add Base Styles**

   - Apply global styles such as fonts, color variables, and layout utilities.

6. **Build the Layout**

   - Style the interface starting from the top (search bar, tabs, contacts list).
   - Ensure responsiveness using media queries or flex/grid.

7. **Add Interactivity with JavaScript**

   - Implement contact filtering by tab (All, Teams, Members).
   - Enable real-time search.
   - Allow selection/deselection of contacts for invitation.
   - Add interactive states (hover/focus/active).
